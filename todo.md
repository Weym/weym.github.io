SEO
- Criar uma imagem para colocar no `<meta property="og:image" content="...">`

Tracking progress

Fix
- sticky content in different resolutions
- section positioning and intro text are mispositioned
- navbar too small on big screens

TODO:
- Consider adding a third theme-color
- Add a button for light-theme, dark-theme and one automatic that will work as I intended
    - Make the default behavior the same as the users computer or as I intended?
- Double check tags, css & js
- Make the blog read content from markdown file
    - Ideally: It will have some sort of index that will work as a category
    - Will read the links
    - Will create the category and list the blog content below it
    - Then create whatever is inside as a blog content once it is clicked, to be read
- Make the blog content drag animation snap in place

Make the README
- Detail the steps taken
- Maybe a case study
- Try to build it into a case study and use it one the blog


Navbar
- When clicking outside the navigation, close it (try to account for a missclick, when the click outside is close to it)
- Make the "Hamburger" menu turn into an "x" once the navbar is open
- Make the text inside the <a> curved to better fit the lines


Responsiveness:
- When the screen is split horizontally with one content on the top half and another on the bottom half, the design breaks
