SEO

- Create image to put on `<meta property="og:image" content="...">`

Fix

- When the screen is split horizontally (example: two screens on the same monitor, one on top of the other instead of side by side) the design breaks
- In smaller screens, display the socials on top

TODO:

- Modularize CSS
- Fix CSS conflict on blog/styles: changing font is not reflecting on other pages

Navbar

- When clicking outside the navigation, make it close (try to account for a missclick, when the click outside is close to it)
- Make the text inside the <a> curved, following the lines
